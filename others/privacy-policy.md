Sometimes, the Site may permit interactions with third-party websites. This enables you to "like" a product or "share" content with third-party websites. In doing so, the information (i.e. that you "like" a certain product) will become public and the third-party website (like Facebook) will have access to this information. In addition, we may receive data about you if other users of a third-party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections”, or if information about you is otherwise accessible through your connection's social networking page.

In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your personal information no matter where that personal information is collected, transferred, or retained. Finally, we may disclose your personal information or any information you submitted via the Site and its services if we have an adequate understanding that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues, or (iii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Oraichain, its users, yourself or the public.
