# OraichainEVM

Oraichain is a high-performance Proof-of-Stake blockchain that provides full compatibility and interoperability with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Built on the Cosmos SDK and running on top of the CometBFT consensus engine, Oraichain achieves rapid finality, high transaction throughput, and minimal block times.

This architecture of Oraichain enables users to execute both Cosmos and EVM-formatted transactions, allows developers to build cross-chain EVM dApps using IBC, and supports tokens and assets from various independent sources while maintaining its core focus on AI Oracle services.

Oraichain achieves these capabilities through:

* Utilizing Cosmos SDK modules and mechanisms for core blockchain functionality
* Implementing CometBFT's Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI) for blockchain management
* Integrating \`geth\` as a library to ensure Ethereum compatibility and maintainability
* Providing a fully compatible Web3 JSON-RPC interface for seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools (Metamask, Remix, Truffle, etc)

These features allow developers to leverage existing Ethereum development tools while accessing Oraichain's unique AI Oracle capabilities and the broader Cosmos ecosystem.
