# OBridge

## OBridge

OBridge functions as a decentralized cross-chain bridge, seamlessly enabling interoperability and liquidity between Bitcoin, Ethereum, TON Network, BNB Chain, Oraichain, and 160+ other blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem (Cosmos, Osmosis, Injective).

OBridge is now live and integrated directly into OraiDEX's AMM, accessible at [https://app.oraidex.io/universalswap](https://app.oraidex.io/universalswap). OBridge will continue to expand its reach by supporting even more blockchains and having more integrations soon.
