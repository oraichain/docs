# Security Remarks

1\. The only accepted callback function is _fulfillRandomness_(bytes32 \_reqId, uint256 \_random) with the function selector being _0x1f1f897f_. This is required in order to avoid malicious callbacks.

2\. The _fulfillRandomness_ function is able to verify the VRF value and minimize the amount of keep3rs that can fulfill data with the following check functions:

* `require(isFulfiller[msg.sender], "Must is fulfiller")` : fulfillRandomness function guarantees that only a fixed amount of keep3rs are able to fulfill data ;
* `require(isNode(validator), "Forbidden validator")`: The VRF value is guaranteed to be generated from Oraichain's validators.

3\. The gas limit is 800,000. This means that any fulfilling or callback request exceeding the limit amount can lead to tx getting reverted, at which case the blockchain oracle will ignore and refuse to execute such request.
