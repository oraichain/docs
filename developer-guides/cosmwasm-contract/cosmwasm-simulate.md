# CosmWasm Simulate - the almighty end-to-end JavaScript simulation test

[CosmWasm Simulate](https://github.com/oraichain/cw-simulate) is an open-source tool that manages contract states to simulate the effects of CosmWasm contracts on the blockchain environments on which they are hosted.

Oraichain Labs forked the repository from [Cosmology Tech](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cw-simulate), increased its testing performance, and added a lot of additional features:

- Simulating IBC states
- Gas simulation
- Simulating address native balances.
- Simulating block creation.
