# Validate a Group Signature

You can always check the validity of a group signature generated by **Oraichain VRF 2.0** via [**Oraiscan**](https://scan.orai.io/randomness/orai15lv4hxxqew2jhfayfmad7y40zfr8zmgfulqdxj)**.**

The field _**Verified**_ shows you the status a group signature:

1. _**True**_ means the group signature you searched had been successfully aggregated and verified on-chain with Oraichain Smart Contract
2. _**False**_ means the group signature you searched are either being verified or did not have the required signatures to form a group signature

![Easily check the validity of a group signature without the knowledge of smart contract](<../.gitbook/assets/1Untitled Project1a931ff9.autosave.gif>)

Search for a round of your choice at the field _**Search**_**.** Note that the round value entered should not be larger than the current round displayed.
