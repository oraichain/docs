### Interblockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) <a href="#what-is-the-interblockchain-communication-protocol-ibc" id="what-is-the-interblockchain-communication-protocol-ibc"></a>

**IBC** stands for **Interblockchain Communication Protocol,** which have been widely used to allow direct communication and asset trading between independent blockchains.&#x20;

> The Cosmos ecosystem has a vision of creating the "internet of blockchains," or a network of independent chains that can communicate in a decentralized way. To reach this goal, the Inter‐Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) was created.&#x20;

As part of the CosmosSDK-based ecosystem, Oraichain integrates the IBC protocol to [OraiDEX](https://blog.orai.io/-eb20ca5c93fe), our CosmWasm smart contract-based decentralized exchange with multi-chain interoperability, optimal speed and lots of liquidity options for users.&#x20;
