# Verifiable and trustless AI Execution

We design and implement **“Proof of Correctness”** and **“Proof of Execution”** for any AI computation. This plays a fundamental role in developing AI Oracles for many smart contracts while enabling smart contracts to safely use the results of AI computation to trigger actions, resulting in an absolute improvement compared to a centralized AI computation that is integrated into smart contracts.

**VRF Subnetwork** is the first subnetwork on Oraichain Mainnet 2.0 and we are now implementing an **AI Executor Subnetwork** with customized Optimistic Rollup and ZK-Rollup modules. With **Proof of Correctness** and **Proof of Execution** mechanisms, we create _**a verifiable and trustless AI Execution environment**_ instead of a centralized AI solution brought to blockchains.
