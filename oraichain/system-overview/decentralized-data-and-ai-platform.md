# Decentralized Data and AI platform

We develop **Data and AI-related hubs** through platforms like Data Hub or AI Marketplace (and other upcoming hubs) and standard protocols for creators like [Royalty Protocol](https://blog.orai.io/introducing-royalty-protocol-on-oraichain-b4b78366beaa) in order to establish decentralized environments for the Web 3.0 data economy and AI-based services.

### **Data Hub**

### AI Marketplace

**Oraichain AI Marketplace** is being upgraded to a new version and is about to launch after Mainnet 2.0 upgrade. With this version, AI Marketplace will allow everyone to become AI API providers, publishing and selling their services as “packages”.

These packages can be integrated to smart contracts via Oraichain AI Oracle mechanism later. This is an important improvement compared to the first version of AI Marketplace.
