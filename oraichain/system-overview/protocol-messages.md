# Protocol Messages

### Cosmos SDK Messages

Since the Oraichain blockchain is built from the Cosmos network, it also supports all message types of Cosmos SDK so that they can be delivered to all nodes for execution and querying. For simplicity, all message types follow the same protocol, which are described on the [Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/building-modules/messages-and-queries.html)

### CosmWasm Messages

Oraichain uses `wasmd` module to leverage the power of smart contracts to build decentralized applications. The CosmWasm team describes clearly these messages in [their documentation](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/smart-contracts/contract-semantics)
